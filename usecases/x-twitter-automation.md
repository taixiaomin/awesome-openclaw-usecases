# X/Twitter Automation from Chat

Full X/Twitter automation through natural language — post tweets, reply, like, retweet, follow, DM, search, extract data, run giveaways, and monitor accounts, all from your OpenClaw chat.

## Pain Point

Managing an X/Twitter presence requires jumping between the app, third-party dashboards, and analytics tools. Running giveaways means manual winner picking. Extracting followers, likers, or retweeters requires scraping scripts. There is no single interface that lets you do all of this conversationally.

## What It Does

TweetClaw is an OpenClaw plugin that connects your agent to the X/Twitter API. You interact entirely through chat:

- **Post & engage** — Compose tweets, reply to threads, like, retweet, follow/unfollow, send DMs
- **Search & extract** — Search tweets and users, extract followers, likers, retweeters, quote tweeters, list members
- **Giveaways** — Pick random winners from tweet engagements with configurable filters (minimum followers, account age, keyword requirements)
- **Monitors** — Watch accounts for new tweets or follower changes and get notified

All actions go through a managed API — no browser cookies, no scraping, no credential exposure.

## Prompts
